# TheMightyMustards

Hackoverflow Hackathon Fall 2024

### Requirements

```
pip install pyserial
```

## Inspiration

Tired of trackers? Ever wondered

## What it does

The Malicious Network Detector will notify the user while browsing if the incoming request is a malicious threat or not. The GUI will track the numbers of blocked or allowed traffic. As network traffic is coming in, the hardware will buzz to notify the user of the traffic, and there will be green for allowed traffic, red for blocked traffic, and blue for other network traffic.

## How we built it

- Arduino fitted with the functions to activate LED lights (3 modes), a buzzer, and a stepper motor
- Personal Computer with Python running code to the Arduino
- VirusTotal API

## Challenges we ran into

- Limited supply.
- API Limitations.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- First ever Hackathon for every member

## What we learned

- Learning how to use Arduino

## What's next for Malicious Network Detector

- Maybe a full product with your support?
